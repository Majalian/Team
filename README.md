A **teacher** at heart, I had been fortunate enough to pass what little I know to many people, thanks to my professional and **volunteer** activity. Interested in both corporate and start-up work experiences.

Native **German** Remote Team and Project Manager with a long and **successful** track record managing remote teams and dispersed projects. Combining German efficiency with a British sense of humour and a recently developed and joyfully encouraged Italian temper (yes, sounds dangerous, doesn't it?) Living in Italy (South) 4 minutes walk from the beach, collecting cats, much to the dog's disgust. **Trying to learn Ruby** with John holding a virtual gun to my head, but **surprisingly enjoying it**.

### Graphic Designer :us: :man:

- [Harley A](https://www.upwork.com/fl/harleya)

As a relative newcomer to graphic design, I have some limitations, but I think I have some talent too. You won’t catch me doing videos or anything that requires coding, but I love creating attention grabbing designs. 

I can do some basic 3D work, or effects, but mostly you’ll see flat design and some very basic cell shading. I think I’m pretty good at color and layout. **Logos**, **posters**, **flyers**, **banners**, photo editing, etc. are my thing and I achieve some success through **LOTS of communication**. My clients help me to succeed thank you. 

It might be worth mentioning that I use software from **Serif Software** in the UK, their older apps and their new line of Affinity Design and Affinity Photo. This means I can output most of the formats you might need if they are not too publisher dependent. 

You can find me at the PC periodically throughout the day and night, about six days a week, right here in Arizona.
